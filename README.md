## üñºÔ∏è Some Input Images

The following sample images are used across various experiments for testing and demonstrations:

- `ash.png`
- `ashgoh.png`
- `df.png`
- `nikolatesla.png`
- `ww.jpg`
- `satrain.mp4`

You can try your own images and videos by replacing these or uploading additional ones to the notebooks.
